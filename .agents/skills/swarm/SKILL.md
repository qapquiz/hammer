# Swarm

Fan out N parallel workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not a concurrency limit. Cap in-flight spawns at what your machine can carry.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in the `pstack models` section of `AGENTS.md` (written by `/skill:setup-pstack`). If the section or that line is missing, run workers on your own model. The aliases `auto` and `inherit-parent` mean the same. If a configured model fails to resolve (`pi --list-models <entry>` finds nothing), run the workers on your own model and say so. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers as backgrounded pi processes (see the Subagents section of poteto-mode), in one bash call:

```bash
pi -p --no-session [--provider <p> --model <m>[:<thinking>]] \
  "<brief>" > /tmp/swarm-worker-<n>.out 2>&1 &
```

Workers run on this machine; give a worker that writes code its own checkout (git worktree) so writers never share a tree. When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, name the branch and its checkout in the brief.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and rerun that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
